1.  Open DuckDuckGo on your Mac or Windows computer.
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Passwords & Autofill**.
1.  Select **Import Passwords...** and follow the steps to import.

**Another way is to download or Export Passwords as a .CSV File (only necessary if you use a third-party party password manager or an unsupported browser):**

1. Open the browser or password manager where you currently have your passwords stored.
1. Find the option to export passwords and download them as a .CSV file.
1. Refer to your browser or password manager's documentation for specific instructions.

    1. On your iPhone go to **System Settings > Safari**.
    1. Select **Export**, check the box for **Passwords**, and save the file in a folder you can remember.
    1. Then, in DuckDuckGo, go to **Settings > Passwords & Autofill**, select the option to import your passwords (if you’re already using DuckDuckGo Password Manager, click on ‘**…**’ in the top right of the screen).
-   **Android**
