## What is the Recovery Code? Why do I need it?

Your Recovery Code is the only way to recover your synced data if you lose access to all the devices on which you have enabled DuckDuckGo Sync & Backup. It provides full, unencrypted access to all your data — so, first and foremost, make sure to keep the Recovery Code private and do not share it with anyone.

While setting up Sync & Backup, you will be encouraged to save your Recovery Code. Copy and paste the code into a safe place, such as a password manager, and/or download a recovery PDF which includes both a QR code and the full Recovery Code text.

## Why is it beneficial to setup Sync & Backup on more than one device?

Setting up Sync & Backup on more than one device makes your bookmarks and passwords easily accessible on each of your devices. If one of your devices is lost or damaged, or if you’re setting up a new device, you can use the second device to recover previously synced data on your replacement device.

## If I lose my device, how can I recover my data?

To recover your data, you’ll either need your Recovery Code or another device with Sync & Backup already enabled. To recover your data using the Recovery Code:

1. Open the DuckDuckGo browser
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sync & Backup**
1. Select **Recover Synced Data**
1. Follow the on-screen instructions, then either:
    - Scan the QR code
    - Enter the alphanumeric code from your recovery PDF

To recover your data using a second device, follow the steps outlined in [Syncing New Devices]({{ site.baseurl }}/sync-and-backup/syncing-new-devices) to add the new device to Sync & Backup.

## I lost my device, lost my Recovery Code, and do not have Sync & Backup currently enabled on any of my other devices. Is there any way to recover my data?

No, unfortunately not – that’s why it’s important to keep your Recovery Code in a safe place, and/or use Sync & Backup on multiple devices. Because Sync & Backup is end-to-end encrypted, DuckDuckGo does not have your Recovery Code and cannot provide access to your data in this scenario.
