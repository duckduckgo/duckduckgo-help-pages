DuckDuckGo Email Protection is a free email forwarding service that removes multiple types of hidden email trackers and lets you create unlimited unique private email addresses on the fly. You can use Email Protection with your current email provider and app (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Proton, etc) – no need to update your contacts or juggle multiple accounts. Email Protection works seamlessly in the background to make your inbox more private.
