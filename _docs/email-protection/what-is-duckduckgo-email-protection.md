DuckDuckGo Email Protection is a free email forwarding service that removes multiple types of hidden email trackers and lets you create unlimited unique private email addresses on the fly. Email Protection works seamlessly in the background to make your existing email account and inbox (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Proton, etc) more private â€” no need to update your contacts or juggle multiple accounts. For more info, please see our [blog post](https://spreadprivacy.com/protect-your-inbox-with-duckduckgo-email-protection/) on Email Protection.

You can sign up for DuckDuckGo Email Protection in a DuckDuckGo mobile browser ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android)) by opening Settings and then selecting Email Protection. On desktop, navigate to [https://duckduckgo.com/email](https://duckduckgo.com/email) while using a DuckDuckGo desktop browser ([Mac](https://duckduckgo.com/mac)/[Windows](https://duckduckgo.com/windows)) or desktop browser extension ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/)/[Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg)/[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/caoacbimdbbljakfhgikoodekdnlcgpk)/[Brave](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg)/[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/duckduckgo-for-opera-2/)).

If you have a [Privacy Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/) subscription, you can enhance Email Protection with [Personal Information Removal]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal), which finds and removes personal data, like your email address, from broker sites that sell it.
