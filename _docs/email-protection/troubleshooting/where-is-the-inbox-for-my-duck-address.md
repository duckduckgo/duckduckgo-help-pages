Email Protection is an email forwarding service that blocks hidden email trackers before sending the mail to your desired forwarding address (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Proton, etc). There is no unique inbox for your Duck Address, as any mail sent to a Duck Address is forwarded to the inbox of the email address chosen when creating your Email Protection account, with trackers removed.
