#### EU Monthly Active Users of Our Online Search Engine

When searching or browsing on DuckDuckGo, we don’t track you, ever. That’s our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> in a nutshell. For example, we do not create unique cookies and, more generally, architect our search engine and browser so that we cannot even create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design.

The European Union (**EU**) requires publication of the average number of monthly active recipients of our search engine service in the EU every six months. As we do not track our users, the average number of monthly active recipients below is based on anonymized data. We have calculated the figures using survey data, which tells us the average number of searches conducted by users, applied against an estimate of the total number of searches conducted from the EU which we also estimate using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/anonymous-localized-results/">Anonymous Localized Results</a>.
