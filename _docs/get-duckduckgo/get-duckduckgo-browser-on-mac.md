To get the DuckDuckGo Private Browser for Mac:

-   Download [directly from DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com/mac) (compatible with macOS 10.15 or later)
-   Download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361) (compatible with macOS 12.3 or later)  

    Please note:
    -   Bitwarden users should download from us directly instead of the Mac App Store, because the App Store version does not include a Bitwarden integration.
    -   If you use your browser to open local files, you should download from us directly. The Mac App Store version does not have access to local files.
