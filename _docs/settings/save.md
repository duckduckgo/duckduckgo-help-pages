<p>
    On the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">settings page</a>, your
    settings are saved via non-personal browser cookies. The DuckDuckGo setting
    cookies are a reflection of your current settings as a URL (see below) but
    without the "k" parameter. For example, the region setting is notated with,
    "kl" and a Canadian region setting would look like kl=ca-en in the URL. The
    cookie for that setting, though, would be named, "l" and it's content would be
    ca-en.
</p>

<p>
    If your settings keep getting cleared, that's because you have some process
    that is clearing your cookies (or you are switching computers). You could make
    an exception for duckduckgo.com from that clearing out process.
</p>

<p>
    To avoid cookies altogether, you could use our
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/params">URL parameters</a>. To make the use of
    the parameters easier on the
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">settings page</a> there is a link
    entitled, <em>Bookmarklets and settings data.</em> Clicking this link will
    expand the Settings box and show you your settings as a web address (URL). You
    can set that web address as your homepage or as a bookmark/favorite, and then
    those settings should be respected thereafter (as long as you start from that
    page).
</p>

<p>
    If you save that URL you can also use it to load/restore your settings from
    the bottom of the settings page as well. For example, you can email yourself
    that URL and then easily restore settings on different computers.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, you can use the
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/settings/cloud-save">Cloud Save</a> system to
    save your settings.
