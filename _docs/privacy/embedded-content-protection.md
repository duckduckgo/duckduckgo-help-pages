When you visit a website that contains embedded content from other social media sites (such as videos, posts, comments, or login buttons), that content often includes a tracking code that those companies use to link your user information (e.g., your IP address and browser details) with your browsing history.

In some cases, like with Facebook, this can happen [regardless of whether you have an account or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-shadow-profiles/). Embedded content from social media companies can detect and store your browsing activity and use it to target content and ads to you, even if the page you're on is not related to that social media service. Sometimes this might be what you want, such as when you're playing a social game with your Facebook account. Most times, though, you likely prefer to keep your browsing activity private.

When you use our [app or browser extension](https://duckduckgo.com/app), DuckDuckGo's Embedded Social Media Protection blocks embedded content from Facebook and YouTube containing tracking code by default. Over time we'll be blocking content from more companies. If you decide to unblock the content, this will load the content's tracking code. While companies will receive some user information each time you unblock content, this protection will help to reduce what they know about you overall.

Signing in to a website through a social media account unblocks embedded content from that social media company automatically, typically until you restart your browser or log out. This means that social media companies can see your activity on sites where you've signed in via their login form. All other DuckDuckGo [Web Tracking Protections](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/) (such as [3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection) on websites you visit) remain active.

## YouTube Video Previews

When we block an embedded YouTube video, this also prevents the video's title and preview from being loaded. If you'd prefer to see video previews by default, you can do so by clicking the “Previews disabled” toggle on any blocked YouTube video. Please note that doing so will allow Google to see your IP address as well as device and browser information, which can be used to uniquely identify you. Enabling previews is still more private than unblocking the video entirely, which can also allow Google to track your browsing activity across sites.

## How to Disable This Protection

You can disable Embedded Social Media Protection for any website by following these instructions:

1. Click the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension icon in your toolbar.
2. Toggle _Protections_ OFF. The page will be added to your list of _Unprotected Sites_, which you can manage anytime from _Settings_.

Note that disabling Protections will also disable DuckDuckGo's [Web Tracking Protections](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/) for the whole site.
