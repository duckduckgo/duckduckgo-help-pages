The DuckDuckGo browser’s phishing and malware protection helps keep you safe while browsing online. Other browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari rely on Google Safe Browsing to provide these phishing and malware warnings. Instead, we built our own solution that doesn’t rely on third parties and never sends or saves your browsing activity or other personally identifiable data to DuckDuckGo servers.  It simply compares the sites you visit against a list of malicious websites and displays a warning if you try to visit them.

## Why is phishing and malware protection necessary?

Phishing and malware are two of the most common online security threats. Cybercriminals use these tactics to trick users into providing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers, or downloading malware that can infect your phone or computer and cause damage or extract personal information. Phishing and malware protection is designed to alert you to sites that have been flagged for making phishing attempts or hosting malware.

## How does phishing and malware protection work in DuckDuckGo browsers?

Phishing and malware protection works by checking the sites you visit against lists of sites stored on your device that have been reported for phishing, unwanted software, and malware. If you attempt to visit a site on this list, you’ll first see a warning message that gives you the option to navigate away safely or continue to the site at your own risk.

## How does DuckDuckGo know if I’ve visited a malicious site without tracking my browsing activity?

We designed a private method of identifying when you visit a site flagged for phishing or malware that doesn't require us to see your browsing activity. Instead, our servers provide your browser with partial information about known malicious websites and a more detailed list of the most common threats. About 90% of the time, this information is enough to warn you about dangerous sites.

Occasionally, more information might be required, in which case the browser sends a very short, anonymized code (first 3-4 characters of the hash of the domain, for example a379) to our servers which returns the necessary information for the browser to determine whether the site is malicious. These anonymized codes contain no personal information and are deleted as soon as the necessary information is returned to your browser. If you see requests sent to protection.duckduckgo.com, they are used for DuckDuckGo phishing and malware protection.
