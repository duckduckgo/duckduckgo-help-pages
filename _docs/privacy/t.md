Through [partnerships]({{ site.baseurl }}/company/partnerships) with developers and companies, DuckDuckGo has been integrated into many applications. In these partnerships, a portion of DuckDuckGo's advertising revenue is sometimes shared back. To assign advertising revenue and collect anonymous aggregate usage information, developers add a unique `&amp;t=` parameter to searches made through their applications.
