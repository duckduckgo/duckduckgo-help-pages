    Through
    <a href="/company/partnerships">partnerships</a> with
    developers and companies, DuckDuckGo has been integrated into many
    applications. In these partnerships, a portion of DuckDuckGo's advertising
    revenue is sometimes shared back. To assign advertising revenue and collect
    anonymous aggregate usage information, developers add a unique "&amp;t="
    parameter to searches made through their applications.
