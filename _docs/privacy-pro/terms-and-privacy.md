## Do I need to share personal information to subscribe to Privacy Pro?

You don’t need to share any personal information with DuckDuckGo in order to use Privacy Pro. We believe the best way we can protect your personal information is to not collect it at all.

We don’t keep logs of your VPN activity and information you submit for Personal Information Removal is stored on your device, not on our servers. Similarly, we don’t process payments, which is done by either Stripe, the Apple App Store, or Google Play Store, depending on how you subscribe.

In addition, you don’t need to create an account in order to use Privacy Pro. Instead, and to protect your identity even further, we assign a random ID to your Privacy Pro subscription that we use to activate your subscription on your devices. This random ID is not connected to any of your Privacy Pro activity or payment information. If you opt to add an email address for ease of activation, it also won't be connected to your Privacy Pro activity or payment information.

## What happens to my data after I cancel my subscription?

If you choose to cancel Privacy Pro, we will delete any personal information we have (for example, your email address) within 30 days, unless we are legally required to keep it longer.
