The DuckDuckGo VPN is the only VPN compatible with DuckDuckGo [App Tracking Protection]({{ site.baseurl }}/p-app-tracking-protection/) for Android.

## Why don't other VPNs work with App Tracking Protection?

Android only allows one active VPN interface at a time per device, and while App Tracking Protection is not a VPN itself, it does require a VPN interface to function.

DuckDuckGo VPN can share that VPN interface with App Tracking Protection because both features are managed by the DuckDuckGo browser.
