The VPN will automatically attempt to reconnect or switch servers if it fails. While the VPN is attempting to reconnect, it will block all Internet traffic temporarily to prevent accidental data leaks until the VPN connection is restored.

## Why do I experience slower internet speeds?

As with any VPN, Internet speeds will decrease slightly because your device traffic must go through the extra step of traveling through an external VPN server before accessing the internet and returning to your device. However, the DuckDuckGo VPN is designed to minimize any impact on Internet speed.

## Do you limit speed, bandwidth, or data volume?

DuckDuckGo VPN does not have any set speed or bandwidth limits or caps, although we reserve the right to impose such limits, for example to prevent abuse or network errors. For more information, please see our [Privacy Pro Terms of Service](https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms).

## How do I access my printer or other local devices?

By default, local networks are excluded from the VPN on Android, iOS, and Mac to allow you to access your printer, smart home devices, and other local devices normally without adjusting any settings.

We plan to similarly exclude local networks on Windows soon. Until then, you can disable the VPN temporarily to access your printer and other local devices.

## Why do some sites or apps not work?

Some site or app developers may block VPN traffic. If a site or app is failing to load, try turning the VPN off before reloading the site or app. If that fixes the issue, you may need to temporarily turn off the VPN when accessing that site or app.

On Android, you can also exclude entire apps from the VPN. If you are experiencing issues regularly with an app while the VPN is on, you can exclude that app from the VPN. To do so, go to the VPN management screen in the DuckDuckGo browser and tap on Excluded Apps under the Manage section. There, you can scroll through a list of all installed apps on your device and disable VPN protections for any apps that you want to exclude from the VPN.

We plan to eventually introduce similar exclusion features on iOS, Mac, and Windows.

If you continue to experience issues with a site or app while the VPN is on, you may be able to exclude that site or app from the VPN, depending on the platform.

To exclude apps from the VPN on Android, open the DuckDuckGo browser and tap on the three dot icon, then go to **Settings** > **VPN** > **Excluded Apps**. There, you can scroll through a list of all installed apps on your device and disable VPN protections for any apps that you want to exclude from the VPN.

We plan to eventually introduce similar exclusion features on iOS, Mac, and Windows.

## Will I need to update firewall settings to use the VPN?

No.
