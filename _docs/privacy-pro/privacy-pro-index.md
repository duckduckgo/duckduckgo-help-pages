Privacy Pro is a three-in-one privacy subscription service from DuckDuckGo that pairs with our other free privacy protections and that you can use directly in our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-duckduckgo/does-duckduckgo-make-a-browser">browser</a>:

-   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/vpn">VPN</a> encrypts your Internet connection across browsers and apps on your entire device and hides your location and IP address from the sites you visit.
-   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal">Personal Information Removal</a> finds and removes your personal details, like your name and physical address, from sites that store and sell it, helping to combat identity theft and spam. Note: Setting up and managing Personal Information Removal requires a Mac or Windows computer.
-   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration">Identity Theft Restoration</a> gets you back on track if your identity is stolen, helping you fix your credit report and recover financial losses.

You can subscribe to Privacy Pro via the Settings menu in the DuckDuckGo browser, available on [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile/ios), [Android]({{site.baseurl }}/mobile/android), [Mac]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-duckduckgo/get-duckduckgo-browser-on-mac), and [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-duckduckgo/get-duckduckgo-browser-on-windows), or via our [website](https://duckduckgo.com/pro).
