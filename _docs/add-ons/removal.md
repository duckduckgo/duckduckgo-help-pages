We've discovered some malicious Chrome extensions, often with the word "video" in the name, are incorrectly sending searches to DuckDuckGo and Bing. Some of the extension names we've seen are "My Video Grid", "Video Tips", and "My Vital Video". **DuckDuckGo is in no way affiliated with these extensions.** However, we would like to help you resolve this issue.

Please refer to [Google’s official instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769) for removing extensions from Chrome.

Some extensions we suspect to be malicious are also listed below, where the company behind these extensions appears in the referrer header of search requests on DuckDuckGo that triggered our fraud detection.

-   CoolSearches New Tab
-   RecipeSearch
-   GameVille

If you have one of these extensions installed or suspect you may have installed a malicious extension, you can help DuckDuckGo identify and mitigate fraudulent requests to our search engine (sometimes known as “botty traffic”) by letting us know.

To report an extension you think is malicious, send an email to [ops@duckduckgo.com](mailto:ops@duckduckgo.com). If you email us, we may contact you using the email provided to troubleshoot the issue.
