    DuckDuckGo finds sites automatically, so there is no reason (or place) to
    submit particular sites or URLs.
</p>

<p>
    Because we generate results using a variety
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources">of sources</a>, information on
    our site is generally flowing from one of those sources. If it is in our
    Instant Answer box, you can identify the source by looking at the
    <em>More at</em> link within the box. It is best to correct misinformation at
    the source so that it will automatically flow to us and all the other sites
    that consume the source.
