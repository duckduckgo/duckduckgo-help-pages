<p>
    We are trying to index punctuation as much as possible, e.g.
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%28">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%28</a>
</p>

<p>
    However, most of the APIs
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources">we use</a> to help generate
    results don't, and so it can be a bit sparse in that regard. That's why in the
    example search you don't see any traditional looking results below our Instant
    Answer box.
</p>

<p>
    Our Instant Answer index does index full punctuation. As it is built out
    further, more and more searches with punctuation should return relevant
    results.
