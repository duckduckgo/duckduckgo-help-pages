When people search, we believe they're really looking for answers, as opposed to just links. For many categories of searches (restaurants, game of thrones, code documentation, etc.), there is usually a specialized search engine (e.g. Tripadvisor), content site (e.g. Musixmatch) or other source (e.g. StackOverflow) that does a better job at actually answering the searches than a general search engine does with just links. Our long-term goal is to get you Instant Answers from these best sources.

To do that, DuckDuckGo gets its results from many sources, including specialized vertical sources delivering Instant Answers on niche topics and crowd-sourced sites like Wikipedia. We also of course have more traditional links in the search results, which we largely source from Bing.

We continue to partner with more and more sources to bring you the best Instant Answers from the best sources. Our focus is on synthesizing it all together into a superior search experience.

Partners and Privacy: As per our strict [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy), we never share any personal information with any of our partners that could lead to the creation of search histories. When we call a partner for information used in search results, it is proxied through our servers so it stays anonymous. That is, any call to a partner looks to the partner as though it is from us and not the user itself, and no unique identifier is passed in that process (e.g., their IP address). That way we can build our search result pages using these 100s of partner sources, while still keeping them anonymous to you.
