    When people search, we believe they're really looking for answers, as opposed
    to just links. For many categories of searches (restaurants, game of thrones,
    code documentation, etc.), there is usually a specialized search engine (e.g.
    Tripadvisor), content site (e.g. MetroLyrics) or other source (e.g. StackOverflow)
    that does a better job at actually answering the searches than a general
    search engine does with just links. Our long-term goal is to get you Instant
    Answers from these best sources.
</p>

<p>
    To do that, DuckDuckGo gets its results from over
    <a href="https://duck.co/ia">four hundred sources</a>. These include hundreds
    of vertical sources delivering niche Instant Answers, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot">DuckDuckBot</a> (our
    crawler) and crowd-sourced sites (like Wikipedia, stored in our answer
    indexes). We also of course have more traditional links in the search results, which we also source from multiple partners, though most commonly from Bing (and none from Google).
</p>

<p>
    We continue to partner with more and more sources to bring you the best
    Instant Answers from the best sources. Our focus is on synthesizing it all
    together into a superior search experience.

Partners and Privacy: As per our strict
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>, we never share any
personal information with any of our partners. The way it works is when we call
a partner for information, it is proxied through our servers so it stays
completely anonymous. That is, any call to a partner looks to the partner as if
is from us and not the user itself, and no user personal information is passed
in that process (e.g. their IP address). That way we can build our search result
pages using these 100s of partner sources, while still keeping them completely
anonymous to you.
