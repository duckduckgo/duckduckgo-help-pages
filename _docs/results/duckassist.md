DuckAssist is an optional feature in our search results that can anonymously generate answers to search queries. To do this, it scans the web for relevant content and then uses AI-powered natural language technology to generate a brief summary of relevant information found. DuckAssist responses always link directly to one or two sources, citing where the answer came from, so you can easily go and get more detailed information. It's important to remember that responses may contain inaccuracies because they're auto-generated from cited sources and based on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/duckassistbot/">crawling the web</a>.

DuckAssist cannot answer follow-up questions, however, we also offer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aichat">DuckDuckGo AI Chat</a>, which is a private AI-powered chat service that supports chat models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and more.

Phrasing your search as a question and in a complete sentence makes DuckAssist more likely to appear automatically and often yields better answers. To turn it off and hide the Assist button visit <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings#aifeatures">DuckAssist Settings</a>.

If you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know</a>.
