## What is DuckAssist and what does it do?

DuckAssist is a new feature in our search results that can anonymously generate answers to search queries. To do this, it scans the web for relevant content and then uses AI-powered natural language technology to generate a summary of that information. Please note responses are auto-generated based on listed sources, and may contain inaccuracies.

DuckAssist cannot answer follow-up questions, however, we also offer DuckDuckGo AI Chat, which is a private AI-powered chat service that supports chat models from OpenAI, and Anthropic, and more.

Phrasing your search as a question and in a complete sentence makes DuckAssist more likely to appear and often yields better answers. To adjust how this feature works, or to turn it off, visit DuckAssist Settings.

If you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know</a>.
