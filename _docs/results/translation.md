Yes! You can easily make it appear by typing in a search query like “[translate good morning to Dutch](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=translate+good+morning+to+Dutch&t=h_&ia=web)”. Like all our search result features, viewing translations is completely anonymous, per our strict [Privacy Policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy).

For our translation feature, we’ve partnered with Microsoft but we still proxy your queries through our servers before passing them to search result and Instant Answer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources/">providers</a>, so they stay completely anonymous.

In addition, when you enter text into the translation module on our search results page, we never save or pass personal information to Microsoft’s translation service. The source text you enter, the source language, and selected translation language are all we need to deliver an accurate translation, which are also [not stored](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/business/notrace/#no-trace) by Microsoft.
