    We will sometimes serve localized results (for searches like
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=restaurants+nearby">"restaurants nearby"</a>) while still keeping you completely anonymous.

<p>
    For some search results you can opt-in to anonymously and securely use your
    browser location, in accordance with our
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>. This will help
    further improve the accuracy and relevancy of search results.
