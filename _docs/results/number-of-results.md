<p>
    We get results from a variety of
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources">sources</a> (including our
    own). Because of this unique way of generating results, we cannot easily
    determine the number of results for a particular search ahead of time. That's
    why we do not display such a number in our search results.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, there are a bunch of reasons you may not be getting as many
    results as you think you should for a particular query.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We try to be
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/syntax">very exact</a> based on
        what you type in, whereas other search engines often change your query
        around a bit. So that is the first thing to look at. That is, if you
        slightly change your query do you get more results?
    </li>
    <li>
        Related to exactness, it could be your use of
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/syntax">punctuation</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        We could have had a brief outage on our side. You could try a hard refresh
        (usually ctrl/cmd-R) to clear your cache and try again.
    </li>
    <li>
        If none of these apply, and you are still getting sparse results for a
        search you think really should be giving you more results,
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">please send in the specific search</a>. It might be something we can easily fix!
    </li>
</ul>
