[Duck.ai](https://duck.ai){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} can save up to 30 of your recent conversations so you can refer to them later. To protect your privacy, these chats are stored locally on your device, not on DuckDuckGo or other remote servers. You can opt out of recent chats at any time in Duck.ai settings.

You can delete all of your recent chats at once by either using the Fire Button within Duck.ai or clearing your browser data. On desktop browsers, you can also delete recent chats individually by clicking the delete icon next to them.

Because recent chats are stored locally on your device, their retention may vary based on the specific browser or app settings. For example, some browsers, such as Safari and the DuckDuckGo browser for Mac and iOS, automatically delete recent chats if you go more than 7 days without visiting duckduckgo.com.
