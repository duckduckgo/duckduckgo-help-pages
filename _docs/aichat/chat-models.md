## Does DuckDuckGo moderate chat responses in any way?

No, we do not filter or modify the responses received from the chat model in any way. As such, responses may contain inaccurate or offensive information. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/content-moderation){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-meta-ai-responsibility/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/guardrailing/#content-moderation-with-self-reflection){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} each have their own moderation policies, and you may see those applied when using their models, respectively.
