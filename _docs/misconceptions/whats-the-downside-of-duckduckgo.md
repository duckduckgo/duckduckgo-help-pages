It's natural to assume that there'd be some kind of downside, since we respect your privacy and we don't track you. But it's a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/company/how-duckduckgo-makes-money/">myth</a> that creepy tracking is a necessary tradeoff. DuckDuckGo does everything you'd expect of a browser and search engine — while still protecting your privacy.

Our free <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/browser">DuckDuckGo browser</a> includes our private alternative to Google search, along with <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/privacy/web-tracking-protections/">over a dozen other privacy protections</a> for your browsing, email, and more. The browser’s comprehensive set of protections is used by tens of millions of people to help take back control of their online privacy.

<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo Search</a> includes news, maps, sports scores, weather, stocks, local results and much more — in addition to the standard links, images, and videos, of course. And unlike Google, it’s actually private and anonymous. Nothing bad about that.
