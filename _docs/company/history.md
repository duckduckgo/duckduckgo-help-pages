<p>
    DuckDuckGo was solo-founded by <a href="http://ye.gg/">Gabriel Weinberg</a> in
    February 2008 in Valley Forge, PA (USA).
</p>

<p>
    It was self-funded until October 2011, when it was backed by Union Square
    Ventures and a handful of angel investors. Since that funding, and a
    <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-partners-with-omers-ventures-to-expand-canadian-presence-and-global-impact/">second round of funding by OMERS Ventures in 2018</a>, the team has expanded to around 60 employees and a bunch of
    <a href="/open-source/opensource-overview">open-source contributors</a>.
