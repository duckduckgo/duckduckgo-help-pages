    We're always looking for innovative ways to improve and
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">spread DuckDuckGo</a>. Below lists the
    main areas where we partner and guidelines for using our technology.
</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>
    Since we produce our own extensions and apps for the major platforms, we've
    found people increasingly confused as to what was produced by us and what was
    produced by others. We encourage you to use our official APIs listed, but
    please also follow these guidelines when promoting your applications:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Please don't use DuckDuckGo in the title. (There can be exceptions so please
        contact us if you think you have a case for doing so). Mentioning us in the
        description is fine.
    </li>
    <li>Please don't use Dax (our mascot).</li>
    <li>
        Please don't pair our search with something that has another privacy policy,
        like another auto-complete service that tracks people, as doing so gives
        users a false sense of privacy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please don't include our search results in any sort of frame (whether
        desktop or mobile) that makes our site embedded within another Web
        application with the notable exception of browser integration. We simply
        don't have the rights to allow framing based on how
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources">we generate our search results</a>. For clarity, browser integration where there is an address bar and our
        site (with branding) takes up the full screen is just fine and encouraged!
    </li>
    <li>
        Please don't use our
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/params">URL parameters</a> to strip our
        branding from our site.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please give us attribution where it makes sense, and where you do link back
        to the
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">encrypted version of our homepage</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have any questions about applying these guidelines in your specific
    situation, please <a href="mailto:open@duckduckgo.com">get in touch.</a>
</p>

<h3>DuckDuckGo as a Search Option</h3>
<p>
    We have many partnerships with apps, browsers and distributions that include
    us as a search option:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/desktop/other-browsers">Browsers</a></li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/desktop/linux-distributions">Linux distributions</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/ios">iOS</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/android">Android</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you want to add us as a search option, please
    <a href="mailto:bd@duckduckgo.com">contact our business development team</a>,
    as we have some standard ways to easily make this happen.
</p>

<h3>DuckDuckGo Site Search</h3>
<p>
    We offer <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/search_box">site search</a> that
    enables you to put a stylized DuckDuckGo box on your site which will take your
    users to DuckDuckGo when they click it. You can further
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">customize</a> the results pages to
    more match your site. However, because of the way
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/results/sources">we generate our search results</a>, we do not have the syndication rights to allow third parties to completely
    syndicate our results. Please see the guidelines above, but this effectively
    means is you cannot keep the results on your site.
</p>

<h3>DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API</h3>
<p>
    We have an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/api">open API</a> for our Instant
    Answers (displayed above our links) based on our
    <a href="http://duckduckhack.com/">open source DuckDuckHack platform</a>. This
    API is not a way to get our full results (including links), and has its own
    attribution guidelines.
</p>

<h3>Get in Touch</h3>
<p>
    We're always interested in exploring more opportunities but we get a lot of
    inbound partnership requests, so it helps to be as specific as possible when
    suggesting a potential partnership. We simply don't have enough time to do
    everything right now, and so what we work on has to be compelling. Please send
    an email to
    <strong><a href="mailto:bd@duckduckgo.com">bd@duckduckgo.com</a></strong>.
