-   Choosing to advertise on DuckDuckGo lets advertisers tap into the broader Microsoft Advertising Network which helps deliver the best click for a campaign to reach customers efficiently.

#### A leader in US and international mobile market share

-   DuckDuckGo [owns the #2 position in mobile market share](https://duckduckgo.com/cloudflare-radar-report) in the US, and 20 other markets including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, India, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

#### Reach valuable users who can’t be found on Google (or other search engines)  

-   Our research suggests that there are millions of DuckDuckGo users who don’t use Google Search. By advertising on DuckDuckGo, advertisers can extend their campaign reach and access even more customers who they otherwise might miss.
