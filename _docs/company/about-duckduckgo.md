DuckDuckGo is the independent Internet privacy company for anyone who’s tired of being tracked online and wants an easy solution.

Unlike Chrome and other browsers, our free, go-to browser comes with over a dozen powerful privacy protections built-in, including our search engine that replaces Google and doesn't track your search history, and our best-in-class tracker blocker that blocks cookies and creepy ads that follow you around. This unique combination of free protections makes our browser the most comprehensive privacy protection you can get with one download.

In addition, we also offer [Privacy Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/), a three-in-one subscription service, integrated into our browser. Subscribers to the Privacy Pro add-on get even more privacy protection with a fast and simple [VPN]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/vpn/), a [Personal Information Removal]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal) service, and an [Identity Theft Restoration]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration) service.

Every day, tens of millions of people rely on DuckDuckGo to protect their online activities, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more. The DuckDuckGo browser, including the Privacy Pro subscription (an optional, paid add-on), is available for download on desktop and mobile devices ({% include ddg-browser-os-list-linked.md %}). Our private search engine is built into the DuckDuckGo browser, but it can also be accessed independently at duckduckgo.com or as a built-in option on other popular browsers.
