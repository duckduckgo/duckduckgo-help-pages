## What Is a VPN?

A VPN, or “virtual private network,” is a cybersecurity tool that creates a private and encrypted connection for internet traffic to and from your device by routing it through a remote server. This encrypted connection, often referred to as a “tunnel,” keeps your online activities private and prevents outsiders from intercepting your data.

Routing your internet traffic connection through a VPN server also masks your IP address, the numerical label that identifies your individual device when you connect to a network. Your IP address can be used to track you across the Internet and provide information about your general location.

When your traffic routes through a remote VPN server, the websites you visit won’t see your real IP address – they'll see that server’s IP address instead. This makes your online actions mostly untraceable back to you.

At the end of the day, the best VPN for you will depend on a variety of factors, including security, speed, server locations, price, and the providers’ privacy practices.  Will you be using your VPN for high-bandwidth activities, or across multiple devices? Is digital privacy a concern to you? Select a service with a strong reputation that balances those factors with reliable performance.
