You may see a map in your search results if it's particularly relevant to your search terms. For example:

-   [_coffee near me_](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coffee+near+me)
-   [_map philadelphia_](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+philadelphia)

You can click on a map result to open an interactive map where you can pan, zoom, search, and look up directions. DuckDuckGo map searches and route planning are powered by [Apple's MapKit JS framework](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).

Note that our strict privacy policy of never tracking you extends to location searches. We do not send any unique identifiers such as IP addresses to Apple or other local providers, and you are still anonymous when you perform map and address-related searches on DuckDuckGo. You can read more about our [anonymous local results here](/privacy/anonymous-localized-results/).
