<h3>Instant Answers</h3>

<p>
    DuckDuckGo uses over
    <a href="https://duck.co/ia">100 sources to provide answers</a> to your
    searches, without the need to click on a result. Just look for the Instant
    Answer above the results:

<p>
    They're open source, so any developer can view them or submit fixes through our <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo">GitHub repository</a>. This also means we have a wide variety of Instant Answers!
</p>

<p>
    Of course, things like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2x+%2B+6+%3D+12+solve&amp;ia=calculator">calculations</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=people+in+space&ia=answer">factual information</a> are covered but what's more interesting are the surprises you'll find as Instant Answers. From <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA+102">checking the status of a flight</a> to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+strong+12&ia=answer">generating a strong password</a>, we've got an Instant Answer for it.

<h3>!Bang Syntax</h3>

<p>
    You can search other sites directly from DuckDuckGo, just by using our
    available <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">!bangs</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For example, if you wanted to search on Amazon.com for, "shoes" you could
    simply type: <em>!amazon shoes</em>
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/028e3901ce00cfae77634090c4858b22.png" />
<p>
    ...which would automatically take you to Amazon.com and search for shoes...
</p>

<p>
    Many of the !bangs even have short versions. Use 'a' for Amazon or 'w' for
    Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>For example: !a shoes or !w shoes</p>

<p>
    There are
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">thousands of sites covered</a> and
    you can even <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/newbang">submit your own!</a>
</p>

<p>
    If you're using our
    <a href="/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser">browser extension</a>
    or, if you have DuckDuckGo as your browser's default search-engine, the !bang
    commands will even work from the address bar or search bar.
    <strong>WARNING: Use of !bangs will forever change the way you search, leaving you
        with more free time and less frustration.
    </strong>
