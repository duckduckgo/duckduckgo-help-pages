<p>
    When searching on DuckDuckGo, you have the ability to limit search results to
    a certain timeframe.
</p>

<p>
    For example, searching for "<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spacex">spacex</a>" could include some older or general results, whereas you might be more
    interested in recent articles and news reports.
</p>

<p>
    If you instead want to see results from the past day, week, or month, you can
    select that from the date filter dropdown to the right of the search box on
    desktop.

</p>

<p>
    On mobile, it's available in the menu by tapping the "3-line" icon at the top
    right. Note that these are both visible after doing a search.

    P.S. We are working on implementing the past year as well!
