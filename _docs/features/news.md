If news search results are particularly relevant for your search, they should
appear automatically in the search results as traditional links or as links
within our news module, for example, [weekend box office][1]. If you add the
word *news* to your search, more news search results should appear
automatically, for example, [cat news][2]. If not enough news results are
appearing automatically, you can get more by clicking *News* under the search
box, for example, [Philadelphia][3].

If you want to narrow your news search to a particular media outlet, the best
way to do that is to include their name or domain name in your search terms.
You can also use our [bangs][4] to more easily navigate to the news search
results on other websites directly, right from the DuckDuckGo search box. There
are bangs for most major media outlets. The full list of bangs are on the
[bangs page][4].

For more info on news rankings, please see our [News Rankings][5] page.
